# OpenOnDemand
is a web-based interface developed by the Ohio Supercomputer Center that provides users with easy, browser-based access to high-performance computing (HPC) resources. Instead of requiring command-line interaction over SSH, Open OnDemand lets users manage jobs, transfer files, and even launch graphical applications directly through a web browser.

OOD integrates with existing HPC systems — including Slurm — to provide a user-friendly layer on top of the cluster’s infrastructure. Users can:

- Submit, monitor, and manage jobs via a graphical job composer.
- Upload, download, and edit files using a built-in file manager.
- Open interactive sessions for remote desktops, Jupyter notebooks, RStudio, and other GUI tools.
- View cluster usage and job queue information in real time.
